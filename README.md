# Deprecated

This library will not follow updates beyond Tabler icons 2.47.0.

- The major version upgrade of Tabler icons has caused the existing conversion
  script to stop working.
- JSR is now recommended instead of deno.land/x.

It is necessary to either use the original Tabler Icons via npm or republish to
JSR. However, due to the inability to allocate time for maintenance, we will
stop updating the library.

# TSX Tabler Icons
